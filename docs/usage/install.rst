Installation
============

**Python Versions**: py_gql supports CPython 3.5 and newer.

**Platforms**: Unix/Posix, MacOS X.

**Dependencies**: py_gql has no direct dependency.

Installing from PyPI
--------------------

A source distribution and universal wheel are available on
`PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/py-gql/>`_.

Installing should be as simple as:

.. code::

    pip install py-gql


Cython
~~~~~~

.. warning::

    This is experimental and might be removed in the future.

The default pip install should install the universal wheel, however for some
extra performance in production py-gql's ``setup.py`` can detect the presence
of `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_ and compile (i.e. cythonize) its own code
with the systemâ€™s default C compiler. This provides significant performance
improvents almost for free.

To benefit from this, run:

.. code::

    pip install cython
    pip install --no-binary :all: py-gql

**Notes**

- The code is not written or optimized for Cython i.e. we use the
  `pure python <http://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/pure.html>`_
  compilation mode.
- Setting the ``CYTHON_TRACE`` environment variable will instruct Cython to
  compile with line trace information useful for profiling and debugging.
  See `this document <https://cython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/src/tutorial/profiling_tutorial.html>`_
  for more details.
- You need Xcode Command Line Tools installed on MaxOS X for this to work.


Installing from source
----------------------

py-gql's source code is hosted on `Github <https://github.com/lirsacc/py-gql>`_.

You can install the development from source after either cloning locally:

.. code::

    git clone git@github.com:lirsacc/py-gql.git py_gql
    cd py-gql
    pip install -e .


Or you can directly install through pip `VCS support
<https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_install/#vcs-support>`_:

.. code::

    pip install git+ssh://git@github.com/lirsacc/py-gql.git@master
