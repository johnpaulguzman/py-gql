"""
GraphQL is a data query language developed by Facebook intended to
serve mobile and web application frontends.

This is a simple GraphQL library for Python meant to be used on its own
to build GraphQL servers. It supports:

- Parsing the GraphQL language (Query language and IDL).
- [WIP] Building a GraphQL type schema.
- [WIP] Validating a GraphQL request against a type schema.
- [TODO] Executing a GraphQL request against a type schema.

You can import from submodules directly and you will find
relevant exceptions in ``py_gql.exc``.
